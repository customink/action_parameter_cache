== ActionParameterCache

This is an alternative to caches_action which allows you to cache actions that don't all go to unique url's but can be differentiated by the parameters that are passed in.

=== Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:

gem 'action_parameter_cache', :git => "git://github.com/customink/action_parameter_cache.git"

=== Usage

You can use the method <tt>caches_action_with_parameters</tt> to specify which actions need to be cached:

  FoobarController < ActionController::Base
    caches_action_with_parameters :index, :parameters => %w{foo, bar, 86}
  end
